    "    - If the variable doesn't exist yet, then it is created\n",
    "    - If the variable does already exist, then its current value is replaced with a new one\n",
    "2. Different kinds of data\n",
    "    - Boolean values (`True`/`False`)\n",
    "    - Numbers\n",
    "        - integers (`int`)\n",
    "        - floats (`float`)\n",

    "3. Conditionals\n",
    "    - We can make our code run on condition that something is `True` with an `if` statement\n",
    "    - To the right of the `if` is a condition that returns either `True` or `False`\n",
    "    - If it's `True`, then the block (indented, just after the `if` is executed\n",
    "    - If it's `False`, then the block just after the `else` is executed (if it exists)\n",

    "        - Put an integer inside of the `[]`, to retrieve one character (starting at 0 from the left side, starting at -1 from the right side) -- `s[3]` or `s[x]` if `x` is an integer.\n",
    "        - Put two integers, separated by a colon, to get a \"slice\", starting at the first index, up to and not including the second index -- `s[4:10]`, which returns a new string\n",
