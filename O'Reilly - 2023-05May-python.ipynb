    "You can design a computer that uses circuits to make decisions -- it gets some input electricity, and based on the various inputs, it then produces some output electricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "That got very difficult, very quickly. Every time you wanted to change the computer's functionality, you needed to rewire the computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer scientists came up with the idea of a general-purpose computer that you could give instructions to... they called that \"programming\" with a \"language.\" Languages have been around since the 1950s. Some were very close to the hardware, and were called things like \"assembly language.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "But you also had some \"high-level languages,\" like Lisp and Fortran and PL/1, which allowed you to write in an English-like syntax, which was then converted into assembly language.\n",

    "Python has been around for about 30 years now. It's a very high level language:\n",

    "- You don't need to worry about the computer's memory\n",
    "- You don't need to worry about what kind of computer you're running on\n",
